| [Exploring Airbnb Market Trends](https://github.com/laiflonglearner/datacamp-project-solutions/tree/main/python/Customer%20Analytics%20-%20Preparing%20Data%20For%20Modeling) |New York City has a variety of Airbnb listings to meet the high demand for temporary lodging for travelers, with several different price levels, room types, and locations. 
In this project, you'll be able to practice your skills in importing and cleaning data and data manipulation to help you report insights to a real estate start-up!|
| [Customer Analytics: Preparing Data for Modeling](https://github.com/laiflonglearner/datacamp-project-solutions/tree/main/python/Customer%20Analytics%20-%20Preparing%20Data%20For%20Modeling) |Being able to create predictive models is very cool, but translating fancy models into real business value is a major challenge if the training data isn't stored efficiently. 
You've been hired by a major online data science training provider to store their data much more efficiently, so they can create a model that predicts if course enrollees are looking for a job. You'll convert data types, create ordered categories, and filter ordered categorical data so the data is ready for modeling.|
| [Analyzing Crime in Los Angeles](https://github.com/laiflonglearner/datacamp-project-solutions/tree/main/python/Analyzing%20Crime%20in%20Los%20Angeles) |Los Angeles, California, attracts people from all over the world, offering lots of opportunities, not always of the good kind!
In this project, you'll serve as a data detective, supporting the Los Angeles Police Department (LAPD) in analyzing crime data to guide how they should allocate resources to protect the people of their city!|
| [Visualizing the History of Nobel Prize Winners](https://app.datacamp.com/workspace/w/4033f679-311c-42eb-b824-19c3ac2bea5e/edit) |Explore a dataset containing a century's worth of Nobel Laureates. Who won? Who got snubbed?|
